## Problem 1

The following problem was attempted (as shown in previous commits and
pushes) but I changed the code to better reflect what was given as the
correct solution after it was posted. I did this in order to have record
of how to do the problem correctly when it is time to review my homework
for studying purposes.

``` r
 month_df = 
    tibble(
    month_num = 1:12, 
    month_abb = month.abb, 
    month = month.name)

pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("fte_data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez"))
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r

    ## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...

    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

When looking at the final joined data, there are `NA` values in the
`close` and `unemployment` variables, which indicates missing values.

The `pols_month_df` data has 822 observations and 11 variables and tells
us about the party affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for
governors and senators for a given year from years 1947 to 2015. It also
tells us whether the sitting president was a democrat or republican.

The `snp_df` data has 787 observations and 3 variables, ranging from
years 1950 to 2015.

The `unemploy_df` data has 816 observations and 3 variables ranging from
years 1948 to 2015.

In Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the
**average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average unemployment rate
over the same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

## Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("trash_data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M586") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year), 
    name = "mr_trash_wheel",
    homes_powered = (weight_tons *500)/30)

prof_trash = 
    readxl::read_excel("trash_data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    name = "prof_trash_wheel",
    homes_powered = (weight_tons *500)/30)

gwy_trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("trash_data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:K157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    name = "gwynnda_trash_wheel",
    homes_powered = (weight_tons *500)/30)

trash_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash, prof_trash, gwy_trash) |> 
  select(name, everything())
```

The Mr. Trash data has 584 observations and 15 variables and tells us
about the types, weight, and volume of trash collected on specific dates
from a water-wheel vessel (named Mr. Trash Wheel) located in the Inner
Harbor in Baltimore, MD.

In an effort to further reduce the amount of trash pollution in
Baltimore, the Healthy Harbor initiative has included three more
water-wheel vessels named: Professor Trash Wheel, Captain Trash Wheel
and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. In this problem, the data for the Professor and
Gwynnda trash wheels were examined. The Professor data has 106
observations and 14 variables and the Gwynnda data has 155 observations
and 13 variables.

When all three data sets are joined together in the `trash_tidy`
dataframe, there are a total of 845 observations and 15 variables. From
years 2017 to 2023, Professor Trash Wheel collected a total of 216.26
tons of trash. Gwynnda Trash Wheel collected a total of 1.63^{4}
cigarette butts in July of 2021.

## Problem 3

``` r
bl_data = 
  read_csv("mci_data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1, col_names = TRUE, na = c(".", "NA")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = 
      case_match(
        sex, 
        0 ~ "female",
        1 ~ "male"),
    apoe4 = 
      case_match(
        apoe4, 
        0 ~ "non-carrier",
        1 ~ "carrier")) |> 
  filter(current_age < age_at_onset | is.na(age_at_onset))
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (6): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4, Age at onset
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

It was important to look at the original csv for baseline data before
importing to get an idea of what I needed to include for the needs of
this problem. Once I observed that the first row had explanatory, but
otherwise had unnecessary information, I decided to use the `skip`
argument in my `read_csv()` function to not include it. It was also
necessary to keep the column names with the `col_names = TRUE` argument
and edit the data to interpret the “.” in the age at onset column as
`NA` using the `na = "."` argument. It was helpful to then clean the
column names into snake case and then proceed with encoding the sex and
APOE4 carrier status and filtering out those participants who did not
have have MCI at baseline. This was done by filtering by ages, if the
participants age at onset was less than their current age, that meant
that they had the MCI at baseline and needed to be excluded.

In total, there were 479 participants recruited and 93 participants
developed MCI. The average baseline age was 65 years old. Within the
total the study participant group, there are 13.1524008 percent of women
who are APOE4 carriers.

``` r
amy_data = 
  read_csv("mci_data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1, col_names = TRUE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename("id" = "study_id") |> 
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "time_elapsed(years)",
    values_to = "amyloid_ratio"
    ) 
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

It was also important to look at the original amyloid csv file before
importing it so that I would know to include the `skip` and the
`col_names = TRUE` arguments within my `read_csv()` function. I then
cleaned the names and renamed the “study_id” column name to just “id” so
that it was consistent with the column naming used in the baseline data.
Also, since the amyloid data set gave measurements of the amyloid ratio
computed at different time points, I decided to use the `pivot_longer()`
function to further tidy the dataset so that time and the ratio can be
separate columns. While this did increase the length of the data set
tremendously, it did help to simplify the readability of the dataset and
make it more tidy. After all of the tidying steps, overall the amyloid
data had a total of 2435 rows with 3 columns.

In attempting to check the participants who only appeared in the
baseline or amyloid datasets, I found a resource online that utilized
the `comparedf()` function within the `"arsenal"` package to be able to
run a detailed summary of differences between two datasets. I installed
the package and compared the `bl_data` and `amy_data` data sets by ID
numbers using the code below.

``` r
library(arsenal)
summary(comparedf(bl_data, amy_data, by = "id"))
```

After running the code, the output resulted in finding 8 participants
only in the baseline data (ID# 14, 49, 92, 179, 268, 304, 389, 412) and
16 participants who were only in the amyloid data (ID# 72, 234, 283,
380, 484-495).

``` r
mci_tidy = 
 inner_join(bl_data, amy_data)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(id)`

``` r
write.csv(mci_tidy, "./mci_data/combined_data.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

Lastly, both data sets were joined by ID number using the `inner_join()`
function. This resulted in a datset with 2355 rows and 8 columns. The
completed data file can be found in my mci_data folder in my data
directory.
